Create a program to find the solution to a quadratic equation.

Line 3-7: We create 3 integer variables with data type double - these are the numbers for the discriminant equation.

line 9-10: This is our discriminant equation and its roots root1 and root2.

line 12-20: We write the conditions using conditional statements if, else if, else, if discriminant > 0, we look for our roots root1 and root2.

Determine the number of the quadrant in which the point with the given coordinates x, y is located.

line 3-4: We have created 2 variables of type double and stored the x,y coordinates

line 6-15: Depending on the condition (if, else if, else) under which our coordinates fall, we print the result.

In this program we will check if the number 25 is two-digit and even.

line 3-8: Create a variable of type int and assign the value 25, then use the conditional statement if 
          we check whether our variable is >= 10 and <= 99 (checking for ambiguity) and whether 25 is divisible by an integer without a remainder.
          If the condition is true, we print the result

Create a text menu in which, when you select the first item, you can calculate
the value of the product of two numbers, when you select the second item
the value of the sum of two numbers, and the value of the difference when you select the third item.

This code implements a simple program using console I/O. When you run the program, you are presented with three possible choices: calculate the product of two numbers, calculate the sum of two numbers, or calculate the difference of two numbers. The user can choose one of these options by entering the corresponding number. After that, the program asks the user to enter two numbers. Depending on the user's choice, the program calculates and displays the result of the corresponding operation.

The class contains the main method, which is the input method of the program. This method creates a Scanner object that is used to receive user input from the console. Then the possible choices of actions are displayed, the values of the corresponding variables are entered and processed using the switch statement. The result is displayed on the screen.

This code can be useful for beginners in Java programming, as it demonstrates simple data input/output and work with the switch statement.
